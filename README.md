This Library is designed to manage a game scoring board. Moreover, I have outlined plans to enhance two essential features: sorting and the persistent storage of scores. By addressing these areas, the program will exhibit improved sorting capabilities and provide a reliable means of permanently storing scores.

## Sorting

The current sorting data structure in the program requires improvement to handle automatic sorting upon insertion or updating of score records. The existing sorting algorithm may not be efficient enough to scale effectively when dealing with a large volume of records

## Solid Persistence

In addition, it is crucial to implement a robust persistence mechanism that ensures the permanent storage of scores. This will guarantee that the scores persist even in the event of program restarts or system failures.
